`Votizen`_ is a consumer technology company dedicated to help voters have a
greater impact in the political process by creating a new political currency
based on voter-to-voter connections and increasing the importance of
relationships in civic engagement. The Votizen API is a REST API which allows
developers to directly harness the power of Votizen into their applications.

The Votizen API boasts a number of unique features, including:

    - **Candidates & Politician Database**
        - Votizen maintains a set of political candidates and politicians with
          contact information to their campaigns and URLs to their online
          identities.

        - Candidates range from those running for the Presidential election to
          those running for their local city councils.

        - The data is updated on a daily basis.

    - **Nationwide Voter Records**
        - The heart of the Votizen API is in the 185 million voter records
          compiled and normalized from Election Divisions within The Secretary
          of State department from each state.

    - **Robust Voter Identification**
        - Voters may be identified from fragmented contact information. Many
          voters can be identified by only their full name and birthday. It
          only takes milliseconds to identify a voter.

        - Voters may also be identified from nothing but their online
          identities such as Facebook and Twitter profiles. *This feature is
          currently planned for future release.*
