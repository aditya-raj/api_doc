The Votizen API is constantly evolving and will regularly be updated with new
features, bug fixes and performance improvements. All changes made to the API
within the current version will be backwards-compatible, ensuring that
launched applications using the presently documented endpoints will continue to
work without modification.

Features that are experimental will clearly be labled in the :doc:`apis` and
are not covered by this guarantee.
